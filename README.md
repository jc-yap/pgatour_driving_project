# pgatour_driving_project
 Analysis of driving on the PGA Tour for courses with different driving difficulties. The main dataset used in the analysis ('2019_data.csv') was too large to upload but can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/bradklassen/pga-tour-20102018-data#2019. To run the code, download '2019_data.csv' and save it in the folder data_files. Smaller test sets can be found in data_files.
